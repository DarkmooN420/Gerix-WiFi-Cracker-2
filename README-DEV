This file is intended for developers who come to the program, and explains the general structure.

The program is made up of some files:

The file gerix.ui can be edited by Qt Creator or Qt 4 Designer and represent the GUI.

The file gerix_gui.py is automatically generated from the command "pyuic4 gerix.ui -o gerix_gui.py" .

The file gerix.py is the heart of the program, and contains the code to work. Encloses the class Main_window_ex (an extension of the class contained in the file Main_window gerix_gui.py) and implements the UI callbacks.

Gerix_config.py file contains the configuration of the program and can 'be altered by the user. Still it requires attention.


NOTES:

To add new callbacks for GUI elements should use the section 'Connections' Qt 4 Designer, and connect the signal to the slot desired. 
You can then implement the slot in the file gerix.py as class method Main_window_ex.

To generate the file gerix_gui.py use the command 'make'. This command runs: 'pyuic4 gerix.ui -o gerix_gui.py'. See the Makefile.


PS:

Enjoy !!!
